### API Testing

A sandbox app for testing API techniques whilst building my knowledge aroubd JavaScript, HTML, JSON, Postman, SASS and CSS..oh, and Postman!

### Update!(110925) This project has evolved into ...

Something with a particular focus on displaying recipe data obtained using Postman (app) GET applying the syntax from (https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Grocery-Products)[Spoonacular].  With a minor tweak to the resulting JSON data (enclose all of output in square brackets) this app produces an HTML page displaying recipe data in a more easily consumed format.
